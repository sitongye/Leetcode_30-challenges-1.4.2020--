# Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
# requirement: linear runtime complexity

# example input:[2,2,1] output: 1

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        x = 0
        for i in nums:
            x = x^i
        return x

# This is a XOR solution, any number with an xor with itself results in 0, thus, number with two occurence will be zero after XOR,
any number with zero with be itself after XOR, thus the return will be that number after operating XOR on the whole sequence
