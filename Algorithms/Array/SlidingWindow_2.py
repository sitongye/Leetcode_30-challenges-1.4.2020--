# Example 2: You are given a binary string s (a string containing only "0" and "1"). You may choose up to one "0" and flip it to a "1". What is the length of the longest substring achievable that contains only "1"?

def find_length(s):
    # curr is the current number of zeros in the window
    left = curr = ans = 0 
    for right in range(len(s)):
        if s[right] == "0":
            curr += 1
        # If the current window has more than one zero, move the left pointer
        # to the right until we have at most one zero
        while curr > 1:
            if s[left] == "0":
                curr -= 1
            left += 1
        ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
    
    return ans
